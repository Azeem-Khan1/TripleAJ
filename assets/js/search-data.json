For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | Benefits of this skill can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example . Here I plan on using the robot example from the college board video and seeing if they can solve the problem, just as a little intro | . . Next example which leads into HW. . Insert a collatz conjecture picture which explains what it is | . . gives them basic algorithm for identifying odds and evens and has them add to it until the rules fit that of the collatz conjectures, this is what they will be graded on . | Insert ipynb file with the basic algorithm. . | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the “collatz conjecture.” and explain your steps in a post on your blog. | .",

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . For the lesson, we are going to take detailed notes for the entire three videos and from those notes, we are going to try to make the lesson as applicable as possible, and so we are thinking of potentially making a video with our own API and algorithm or explaining other APIs that have similar algorithms, this would be innovative. .
