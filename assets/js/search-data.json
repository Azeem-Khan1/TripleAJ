Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement (See Example B) | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . Example B . Homework Assignment (DUE WEDNESDAY 12/07 BY 8:00 PM) . Consider this situation: . You&#39;re playing a short game using a random number generator from 1 to 10 . Each person will generate 3 random numbers . | Whoever&#39;s numbers have the highest sum (or score) wins (add up the three numbers) . If there is a draw, generate 3 new numbers until someone wins | . | . | . | . Your TASK: . Create a flowchart that can be used to write an algorithm that determines if a player wins or loses the game . NOTE: Don&#39;t forget the syntax for Flowcharts! (each shape represents an action) . | Try to implement selection and/or iteration in your algorithm . | Please do this using Google Drawing. It can be found in your Google Drive if you click New &gt; More &gt; Google Drawings . | . | Write the working algorithm in Python . You may use the template code block provided below . | Make sure to initialize / define any variables you may need . | Use hypothetical numbers if necessary (make comments) . | . | How to submit: . Make a shareable link to your Flowchart with commenting access through Google Drive&#39;s &quot;Share&quot; feature . | Make a comment with the link at the top of the code block that holds your algorithm (use # for comments in Python) . | Submit a link to your algorithm (with the commented link to Flowchart) here . | Grading .

For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd); . display(“choose value for x”) . x &lt;- input() . if(n mod2 = 0) . { Display (“n is even”) } . ELSE . { Display (“n is odd”) } . how can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . adding steps 2 and 3 from the original equation | . display(“choose value for x”) . x &lt;- input() . if(x mod 2 = 0) { x &lt;- n/2 # right here } ELSE { x &lt;- n * 3 + 1 . # and here } .

Takeaways . You can use code you’ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | .

In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson created by Akshat P. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . . EXAMPLE #1 - Too Hot, too cold, or just right? . What similarities do you notice about the two algorithms? . If the boolean expressions are the same, does that mean the results will be the same? . . What happens if we assign 54 to our algorithm? . When we alter and set limitations to our code, the algorithm would not work if we were to input a variable that does not satisfy the rules for the algorithm. . . What happens if we assign 95 to our algorithm? . Since 95 is greater than 90, it is true, however else is also to be considered, and so this satisfied the conditionals (we learned this a week ago). Since 95 is also greater than or equal to 65, the algorithm satisfies. . Therefore both situations DO NOT yield the same results. . This is a simple overview on how algorithms work along with conditionals. . .",
