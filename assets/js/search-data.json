The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . For the lesson, we are going to take detailed notes for the entire three videos and from those notes, we are going to try to make the lesson as applicable as possible, and so we are thinking of potentially making a video with our own API and algorithm or explaining other APIs that have similar algorithms, this would be innovative. .

Focused on creating or developing algorithms using a flowchart or natural language | An algorithm can contain selection or iteration Either way, they need to be sequenced properly in order to have the intended result | . | . How to set up a FLowchart . A Flowchart can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm | Step 1: label the start point | Step 2: consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask | Step 3: write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is true | Step 4: repeat step 3, but this time, if the answer is false | Step 5: write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly | Step 6: determine a way to reach the end goal | . Selection vs. Iteration . Example A . Consider this situation: You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off | There is another sale on produce for 20% off | Tax on all items is 8% | Your TASK: calculate the cost of your favorite item using an algorithm!
