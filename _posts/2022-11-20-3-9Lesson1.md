# Lesson Overview/Plan

The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. 

3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed.

For the lesson, we are going to take detailed notes for the entire three videos and from those notes, we are going to try to make the lesson as applicable as possible, and so we are thinking of potentially making a video with our own API and algorithm or explaining other APIs that have similar algorithms, this would be innovative. 

Some ideas:
- Blackjack
- Flip a coin
- 8 Ball
